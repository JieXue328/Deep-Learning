### Neural Network in Supervised Learning:
| Input(x)          | Output(y)              | Application         |NN Implementation |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Home features     | Price                  | Real Estate         |Standard NN       |
| Ad, user info     | Click on Ad?(0/1)      | Online Advertising  |Standard NN       |
| Image             | Object(1,...,1000)     | Photo tagging       |CNN               |
| Audio             | Text transcript        | Speech recognition  |RNN               |
| English           | Chinese                | Machine translation |RNN               |
| Image, radar info | Position of other cars | Autonomous driving  |Hybrid            |

### Structured Data VS. Unstructured Data
Unstructured data: image, audio, text

### Why is Deep Learning taking off? 
Scale drives deep learning progress.
* Data
* Computation
* Algorithms

Two things have to be considered to get to the high level of performance:
1. Being able to train a big enough neural network
2. Huge amount of labeled data
